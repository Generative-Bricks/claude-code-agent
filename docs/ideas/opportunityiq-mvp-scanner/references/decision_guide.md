# OpportunityIQ MVP: Decision Guide & Quick Start

## What You Have Now

You have **two complete paths** to build and validate OpportunityIQ:

### Path 1: Full MVP (2-4 weeks)
**File**: `opportunityiq_mvp_plan.md`

- 4 separate Skills (Scanner, Revenue Calculator, Ranker, Reporter)
- 6-8 scenarios (comprehensive coverage)
- 25-50 test clients
- Full workflow with email formatting
- More thorough validation

**Choose this if**: You want comprehensive validation before committing, have time for 2-4 week test, need to prove multiple revenue types

### Path 2: Rapid MVP (1 week)
**File**: `opportunityiq_rapid_mvp.md`

- 1 integrated Skill (all-in-one)
- 3 scenarios (highest revenue only)
- 10 test clients
- Simple text output
- Fast proof of concept

**Choose this if**: You want to prove concept ASAP, need quick win for stakeholders, want to iterate rapidly

## Recommended Approach: **Start with Rapid MVP, Expand if Successful**

### Week 1: Rapid MVP (Path 2)
- 3 scenarios (FIA, Cash, Concentration)
- 10 clients
- 1 skill
- Goal: Prove the concept works

### Week 2-4: Expand to Full MVP (Path 1) if Week 1 succeeds
- Add 3-5 more scenarios
- Expand to 25-50 clients
- Build full skills suite
- Goal: Validate production readiness

**Why this approach?**
- Fastest to first results (1 week vs 2-4 weeks)
- Lower risk (less upfront investment)
- Easier to pivot if needed
- Natural expansion path if successful

3. Confirm these 3 scenarios work

**I will build**:
- Complete OpportunityIQ MVP Scanner skill

- Timeline: 2-4 weeks to production-ready

### Option C: Sample Data First (Safest)

**I provide**:

## FAQ

**Q: Can we start with my real client data today?**
A: Yes, if you have a Google Sheet ready. Otherwise I can create template and you populate, or we use sample data first.

**Q: How long does skill take to build?**
A: Rapid MVP skill: 1-2 days. Full MVP skills: 1-2 weeks.

**Q: What if the revenue estimates are way off?**
A: We'll adjust the calculation formulas. That's exactly what MVP testing is for.

**Q: Can I add more scenarios later?**
A: Absolutely. The skill is designed to be modular and expandable.

**Q: What if I don't have all the data fields?**
A: We'll start with what you have and note gaps for later. MVP works with partial data.

**Q: How do I know if this is worth building into full product?**
A: If you find 5+ real opportunities from just 10 clients and would pay $89/month yourself, it's worth building.

**Q: Do I need to share my actual client names?**
A: No. You can anonymize in test data (Client A, Client B, etc.) or use fake names.

**Q: What happens after MVP succeeds?**
A: Three options:
1. Scale up within Claude Skills (25-50 clients)
2. Build production version with your dev team
3. License/white-label to other advisors

## The Simple Truth

**You have two choices**:

**Choice 1**: Spend 1 week, prove this works with 3 scenarios and 10 clients → Rapid MVP

**Choice 2**: Spend 2-4 weeks, comprehensive validation with 6-8 scenarios and 25-50 clients → Full MVP

**My recommendation**: Choice 1. Prove it fast, expand if it works.

Either way, I can start building TODAY if you're ready.
