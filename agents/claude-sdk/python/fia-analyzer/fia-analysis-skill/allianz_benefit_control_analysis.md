---

## Scoring Formula

```
Suitability Score = (Total YES Answers ÷ Total Answerable Questions) × 100
```

**Important Notes:**
- Only count questions that CAN be answered with available data
- Questions marked as "N/A" or "Unable to Answer" are excluded from BOTH numerator and denominator
- This ensures fair scoring when complete data is not available

**Calculation Steps:**
1. Review all 40 questions
2. Identify questions you CAN answer (have sufficient data)
3. Count total answerable questions (denominator)
4. Count YES answers among answerable questions (numerator)
5. Calculate percentage

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Complete Data**
- 40 questions total
- All 40 answerable
- 32 answered YES
- Score = (32 ÷ 40) × 100 = 80%

**Scenario 2: Partial Data**
- 40 questions total
- 5 cannot be answered (missing data)
- 35 answerable questions
- 28 answered YES
- Score = (28 ÷ 35) × 100 = 80%

**Scenario 3: Limited Data**
- 40 questions total
- 15 cannot be answered
- 25 answerable questions
- 20 answered YES
- Score = (20 ÷ 25) × 100 = 80%

Notice all three scenarios yield the same 80% score despite different data availability - this is the correct approach.

- Discuss specific index and crediting method selections
